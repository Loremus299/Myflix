A local only movie tracker for your movie watchlist :3 track movies, tv series and filter through your content for intentional and organized backlog management. I made it cus I love keep track of genres and movies I enjoy and it helps me recommend things to others :3

## Why

Doesn't require an account. Doesn't store or sell any of your information. All the data is stored in your browser. Just helps you organize your backlog and watchlist better, tackle it more intelligently and helps you recommend things to others :3 I was just looking for something like letterboxd without the risk of submitting my entire data to them so I made this :3
